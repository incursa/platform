# Outbox Join / Fan-In Support

This document describes the join/fan-in functionality added to the Incursa Platform outbox framework.

## Overview

The join/fan-in feature enables coordination of multiple outbox messages, allowing you to execute a follow-up action only after all related messages have completed (or failed) according to defined rules.

This is useful for scenarios like:
- **ETL workflows**: Fire N parallel data extraction jobs, then start transformation only when all extractions complete
- **Multi-step processing**: Coordinate multiple independent operations before proceeding to the next phase
- **Aggregation tasks**: Collect results from multiple workers before generating a summary

## Core Concepts

### Join (OutboxJoin)

A **join** represents a group of related outbox messages. It tracks:

- `JoinId`: Unique identifier for the join
- `PayeWaiveTenantId`: Tenant scoping
- `ExpectedSteps`: Total number of steps expected to complete
- `CompletedSteps`: Count of steps that completed successfully
- `FailedSteps`: Count of steps that failed
- `Status`: Current state (Pending, Completed, Failed, Cancelled)
- `Metadata`: Optional JSON metadata for join configuration

### Join Member (OutboxJoinMember)

A **join member** represents the association between a join and an outbox message. This many-to-many relationship allows:
- One join to track multiple messages
- One message to participate in multiple joins

## Usage

### 1. Starting a Join

```csharp
// Create a join expecting 3 steps
var joinId = await outbox.StartJoinAsync(
    tenantId: 12345,
    expectedSteps: 3,
    metadata: """{"workflow": "customer-import"}""",
    cancellationToken);
```

### 2. Attaching Messages to a Join

```csharp
// Enqueue messages and attach them to the join
var messageId1 = await outbox.EnqueueAsync("extract.customers", payload1, cancellationToken);
await outbox.AttachMessageToJoinAsync(joinId, messageId1, cancellationToken);

var messageId2 = await outbox.EnqueueAsync("extract.orders", payload2, cancellationToken);
await outbox.AttachMessageToJoinAsync(joinId, messageId2, cancellationToken);

var messageId3 = await outbox.EnqueueAsync("extract.products", payload3, cancellationToken);
await outbox.AttachMessageToJoinAsync(joinId, messageId3, cancellationToken);
```

### 3. Handler Implementation

**Important**: As of the latest version, join completion is reported **automatically** when the outbox message is marked as dispatched or failed. Your handlers no longer need to manually call `ReportStepCompletedAsync` or `ReportStepFailedAsync`.

Simply implement your handler as normal:

```csharp
public class ExtractCustomersHandler : IOutboxHandler
{
    public string Topic => "extract.customers";
    
    public async Task HandleAsync(OutboxMessage message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Do the work
        await ExtractCustomersAsync(cancellationToken);
        
        // That's it! When this completes successfully, the outbox framework
        // will automatically report join completion for any joins this message
        // is part of.
        
        // If an exception is thrown and the handler continues to fail until the
        // message is permanently failed, the framework will automatically report
        // join failure. Note that temporary failures (which trigger retries) do
        // not increment the join's FailedSteps counter.
    }
}
```

This automatic behavior is implemented in the database stored procedures (`Outbox_Ack` and `Outbox_Fail`), which check if the message is part of any joins and update the join counters accordingly. This eliminates the need to leak join semantics into your handler code.

**Note**: The manual methods `ReportStepCompletedAsync` and `ReportStepFailedAsync` are still available in the `IOutbox` interface for backward compatibility and edge cases where you might need explicit control over join reporting.

**Warning**: Do not mix manual and automatic join reporting for the same message. If you manually report completion/failure, the automatic reporting may not work correctly. The manual methods should only be used when you've completely disabled the automatic behavior or need to report join status independently of message processing outcome (edge cases only).

### 4. Setting up Fan-In Orchestration

Use the `EnqueueJoinWaitAsync` extension method to orchestrate the fan-in:

```csharp
// Simple approach using extension method
await outbox.EnqueueJoinWaitAsync(
    joinId: joinId,
    failIfAnyStepFailed: true,
    onCompleteTopic: "transform.start",
    onCompletePayload: """{"transformId": "customer-import-123"}""",
    onFailTopic: "notify.failure",
    onFailPayload: """{"reason": "Some extractions failed"}""",
    cancellationToken: cancellationToken);
```

Alternatively, you can manually create the payload if needed:

```csharp
var waitPayload = new JoinWaitPayload
{
    JoinId = joinId,
    FailIfAnyStepFailed = true,
    OnCompleteTopic = "transform.start",
    OnCompletePayload = """{"transformId": "customer-import-123"}""",
    OnFailTopic = "notify.failure",
    OnFailPayload = """{"reason": "Some extractions failed"}"""
};

await outbox.EnqueueAsync(
    "join.wait",
    JsonSerializer.Serialize(waitPayload),
    cancellationToken);
```

The `JoinWaitHandler` will:
1. Check if all steps are finished (CompletedSteps + FailedSteps = ExpectedSteps)
2. If not, abandon the message for retry later
3. If yes, determine if the join succeeded or failed
4. Update join status
5. Enqueue the appropriate follow-up message

## How Automatic Join Reporting Works

The automatic join reporting is implemented at the database level in the outbox stored procedures:

1. **On Success (`Outbox_Ack`)**: When a message is marked as successfully dispatched, the stored procedure:
   - Marks the outbox message as processed
   - Checks if the message is part of any joins (via `OutboxJoinMember` table)
   - Increments the `CompletedSteps` counter for each associated join
   - Marks the join member as completed

2. **On Failure (`Outbox_Fail`)**: When a message is permanently failed, the stored procedure:
   - Marks the outbox message as failed
   - Checks if the message is part of any joins
   - Increments the `FailedSteps` counter for each associated join
   - Marks the join member as failed

This approach has several advantages:
- **Decoupling**: Handlers don't need to know about joins
- **Consistency**: Updates to message status and join counters happen in the same transaction
- **Performance**: No additional round trips to the database
- **Backward compatibility**: Works with existing deployments; if join tables don't exist, the logic is skipped

## Configuration Options

### JoinWaitPayload

- `JoinId`: The join to wait for
- `FailIfAnyStepFailed`: If true (default), join fails if any step failed. If false, join completes successfully even with failures.
- `OnCompleteTopic` / `OnCompletePayload`: Message to enqueue when join completes successfully
- `OnFailTopic` / `OnFailPayload`: Message to enqueue when join fails

## Database Schema

The join functionality uses two tables:

### OutboxJoin

```sql
CREATE TABLE [infra].[OutboxJoin] (
    JoinId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT NEWID(),
    PayeWaiveTenantId BIGINT NOT NULL,
    ExpectedSteps INT NOT NULL,
    CompletedSteps INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    FailedSteps INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    Status TINYINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    CreatedUtc DATETIME2(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT SYSUTCDATETIME(),
    LastUpdatedUtc DATETIME2(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT SYSUTCDATETIME(),
    Metadata NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL
);
```

### OutboxJoinMember

```sql
CREATE TABLE [infra].[OutboxJoinMember] (
    JoinId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NOT NULL,
    OutboxMessageId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NOT NULL,
    CreatedUtc DATETIME2(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT SYSUTCDATETIME(),
    CONSTRAINT PK_OutboxJoinMember PRIMARY KEY (JoinId, OutboxMessageId),
    CONSTRAINT FK_OutboxJoinMember_Join FOREIGN KEY (JoinId) 
        REFERENCES [infra].[OutboxJoin](JoinId) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Registration

The join functionality is automatically registered when using the platform services:

```csharp
services.AddPlatformMultiDatabaseWithList(databases, enableSchemaDeployment: true);
```

This registers:
- `IOutboxJoinStore` implementation
- `JoinWaitHandler` for processing `join.wait` messages
- Schema deployment for join tables (when `enableSchemaDeployment` is true)

## Best Practices

1. **Always set ExpectedSteps correctly**: The join will not complete until CompletedSteps + FailedSteps equals ExpectedSteps
2. **Keep handlers simple**: With automatic join reporting, your handlers don't need any join-specific logic
3. **No need to include joinId in payloads**: Since handlers don't report completion manually, you don't need to pass the joinId through the payload
4. **Use metadata for debugging**: Store workflow information in join metadata for easier troubleshooting
5. **Monitor join status**: Query OutboxJoin table to track long-running joins
6. **Set appropriate retry delays**: The `join.wait` message will be retried according to standard outbox backoff settings

## Limitations

1. **No cross-tenant joins**: Joins are scoped to a single PayeWaive tenant
2. **No timeout mechanism**: Joins don't automatically fail after a timeout (implement separately if needed)
3. **Single-database join store**: The current implementation uses a singleton `SqlOutboxJoinStore` that connects to one database. In multi-database scenarios, joins only work within the configured database. This is a known limitation that will be addressed in a future update with a provider pattern similar to the outbox store provider.

## Example: ETL Workflow

```csharp
// 1. Start join for 3 extraction tasks
var joinId = await outbox.StartJoinAsync(
    tenantId: customerId,
    expectedSteps: 3,
    metadata: """{"type": "etl", "phase": "extract"}""",
    cancellationToken);

// 2. Enqueue extraction messages and attach them to the join
// Note: The payload no longer needs to contain the joinId
var extractPayload = new { CustomerId = customerId };

var msg1 = await outbox.EnqueueAsync("extract.customers", JsonSerializer.Serialize(extractPayload), cancellationToken);
await outbox.AttachMessageToJoinAsync(joinId, msg1, cancellationToken);

var msg2 = await outbox.EnqueueAsync("extract.orders", JsonSerializer.Serialize(extractPayload), cancellationToken);
await outbox.AttachMessageToJoinAsync(joinId, msg2, cancellationToken);

var msg3 = await outbox.EnqueueAsync("extract.products", JsonSerializer.Serialize(extractPayload), cancellationToken);
await outbox.AttachMessageToJoinAsync(joinId, msg3, cancellationToken);

// 3. Set up fan-in to start transformation when all extractions complete
await outbox.EnqueueJoinWaitAsync(
    joinId: joinId,
    failIfAnyStepFailed: true,
    onCompleteTopic: "etl.transform",
    onCompletePayload: JsonSerializer.Serialize(new { CustomerId = customerId }),
    cancellationToken: cancellationToken);
```

The handlers for `extract.*` topics can now be implemented without any join-specific logic:

```csharp
public class ExtractCustomersHandler : IOutboxHandler
{
    public string Topic => "extract.customers";
    
    public async Task HandleAsync(OutboxMessage message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var payload = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<ExtractPayload>(message.Payload);
        
        // Just do the work - join completion is automatic!
        await ExtractCustomersAsync(payload.CustomerId, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

When all three extraction handlers complete successfully, the `JoinWaitHandler` will automatically trigger the transformation.
