# Database Provider Split & Postgres Readiness Notes

Last updated: 2025-02-14

## Goal
Split the platform into a provider-agnostic core (`Incursa.Platform`) plus a SQL Server provider package (proposed: `Incursa.Platform.SqlServer`). This isolates SQL Server-only types, stored procedures, and SQL-specific DI wiring so future providers (e.g., Postgres) can be added without entangling the core.

## Current SQL Server Surface Area (high-level)
- SqlClient usage across outbox/inbox/scheduler/fanout/leases/semaphores/metrics.
- Schema deployment and stored procedure generation in `DatabaseSchemaManager` and SQL scripts in `src/Incursa.Platform.SqlServer/Database/*.sql`.
- DI entrypoints register SQL Server implementations directly (e.g., `AddSqlOutbox`, `AddPlatformMultiDatabaseWithList`).
- Platform lifecycle validation uses `SqlConnection`.
- Dapper type handlers are registered from core, but only used by SQL Server implementations.

## SQL Server-specific features to extract
These are SQL Server-only constructs that should live in the SQL Server provider:
- T-SQL stored procedures, `MERGE`, `OUTPUT inserted`, `TOP`, `@@ROWCOUNT`, `SCOPE_IDENTITY`, `CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE`.
- Locking hints: `READPAST`, `UPDLOCK`, `ROWLOCK`, `HOLDLOCK`.
- `sp_getapplock` gate/lease behavior.
- SQL Server types: `UNIQUEIDENTIFIER`, `NVARCHAR(MAX)`, `DATETIMEOFFSET`, `ROWVERSION`, `BIT`, `SYSNAME`, `IDENTITY`.
- Table-valued parameters (`GuidIdList`, `StringIdList`).
- Columnstore index usage for metrics.

## Proposed Project Split
### Core (`Incursa.Platform`)
Keep provider-agnostic abstractions and orchestration:
- Interfaces: `IOutbox`, `IOutboxStore`, `IInbox`, `IScheduler*`, `IFanout*`, `ISystemLease`.
- Routing/selection: `*Router`, `*SelectionStrategy`, round-robin strategies.
- Background orchestration that is not tied to a DB provider (e.g., multi-outbox/inbox polling).
- General utilities and identifiers.
- `IDatabaseSchemaCompletion` + `DatabaseSchemaCompletion` (provider-agnostic coordination).
- Provider-agnostic DI helpers (e.g., `AddTimeAbstractions`, handler registration).

### SQL Server Provider (`Incursa.Platform.SqlServer`)
Move SQL Server-specific code and API surface here:
- All `Sql*` implementations and options/validators.
- Schema deployment (`DatabaseSchemaManager`, `DatabaseSchemaBackgroundService`) and SQL artifacts.
- SQL Server DI entrypoints (`AddSqlOutbox`, `AddSqlInbox`, `AddSqlScheduler`, `AddPlatform*` that register SQL Server providers).
- Dapper type handler registration/module initializer (SQL Server provider will own Dapper).
- SQL Server lifecycle validation (`PlatformLifecycleService`).

## Postgres Readiness (to revisit later)
When provider split is stable, evaluate Postgres implementation details:
- `MERGE` -> `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` with `RETURNING`.
- `READPAST`/`UPDLOCK` -> `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.
- `sp_getapplock` -> `pg_try_advisory_lock` / `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock`.
- Table-valued params -> `uuid[]`/`text[]` + `UNNEST` or temp tables.
- Columnstore -> B-tree/BRIN/TimescaleDB alternatives.
- `ROWVERSION` -> `xmin` or explicit `bigint` version column.

## Open Questions / Follow-ups
- Should `PlatformServiceCollectionExtensions` (AddPlatform* helpers) stay in core or move to the SQL Server provider?
- Should SQL artifacts in `src/Incursa.Platform.SqlServer/Database` move under the SQL Server provider package?
- Do we want core to expose any provider-agnostic schema deployment interface?

## DBUp Migration Analysis (schema management in-library)
### Current state (baseline)
- Schema deployment is done via `DatabaseSchemaManager` and ad-hoc SQL execution with batch splitting.
- Schema integrity is checked in tests via `schema-versions.json` snapshot hashes (see `tests/Incursa.Platform.Tests/SchemaVersionSnapshot.cs`).
- SQL artifacts live under `src/Incursa.Platform.SqlServer/Database/*.sql` and are executed in order in tests.

### DBUp feasibility
- DBUp supports SQL Server and Postgres via provider packages (`DbUp.SqlServer`, `DbUp.Postgresql`).
- Embedding scripts as resources or loading from disk is supported; we can keep provider-specific script sets.
- DBUp is “up” only and tracks applied scripts in a journal table; it does not do full drift detection.
- DBUp can use a dedicated journal table per schema/module to avoid conflicts with other DBUp users.

### What changes are required
- Replace `DatabaseSchemaManager` with DBUp-based migration runner per provider.
- Move SQL artifacts into provider-specific migration folders:
  - `src/Incursa.Platform.SqlServer/Migrations/*.sql`
  - `src/Incursa.Platform.Postgres/Migrations/*.sql` (future)
- Add script naming conventions for ordering (e.g., `001_Initial.sql`, `002_Add_Column.sql`).
- Use provider-specific script batches (SQL Server uses `GO`; Postgres does not).
- Update schema deployment flow (currently `DatabaseSchemaBackgroundService`) to run DBUp per database discovered.
- Replace `schema-versions.json` snapshots with DBUp journal snapshots or keep snapshot mechanism as an additional drift check.

### DBUp limitations / drift detection
- DBUp only knows what scripts have run; it does not detect manual drift in schema objects.
- Drift detection options:
  - Keep `schema-versions.json` hashing to verify expected scripts vs. production.
  - Add lightweight schema verification checks (e.g., required tables/columns) similar to current tests.
  - Use an external schema compare tool in CI if deeper drift detection is needed.

### SQL Server specifics to consider
- `CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE` and statements with `GO` require SQL Server-specific batch splitting (DBUp supports this for SQL Server scripts).
- Some statements are not allowed inside a transaction; DBUp supports `RunInTransaction(false)` per script if needed.
- Current stored procedures can remain, but should be moved into ordered migration scripts.

### Postgres considerations (for parity later)
- Need a parallel migration set with `CREATE FUNCTION`/`CREATE PROCEDURE` equivalents.
- Replace SQL Server-only types and locking hints as noted earlier.
- Ensure ordering is consistent so logical schema version numbers align across providers.

### Suggested migration plan
1) Introduce DBUp in SQL Server provider: embed `*.sql` migrations and replace `DatabaseSchemaManager` usage.
2) Keep schema snapshot tests, but drive hashes from DBUp migration list rather than `DatabaseSchemaManager`.
3) Add a provider-agnostic migration runner interface in core to call the provider-specific DBUp runner.
4) Later, add Postgres provider with a parallel migration set and comparable version numbering.

### Recommendation note
Given the platform’s concurrency primitives and heavy reliance on DB-specific behavior, a SQL-first migration approach (DBUp) is the least disruptive and most faithful. FluentMigrator or EF Core would still require raw SQL for the critical behaviors, which negates much of their advantage. DBUp also keeps the migration logic owned by the library without introducing an external toolchain.
